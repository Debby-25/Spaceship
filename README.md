Spaceship Titanic – Passenger Transport Prediction

Overview
This project explores the Spaceship Titanic dataset from Kaggle, where passengers mysteriously disappeared during an interstellar voyage. The task? Predict whether each passenger was transported to another dimension using machine learning techniques.
Built with XGBoost, Scikit-learn, and Streamlit, this app delivers real-time predictions with a futuristic dashboard interface.

 Tech Stack
- Python
- Streamlit
- Pandas / Numpy
- Scikit-learn / XGBoost
- Matplotlib / Seaborn

Key Features
- Predict if a passenger was “Transported” using custom inputs
- Interactive Streamlit UI for testing various conditions
- EDA notebook included for visualizing feature impact
- Model tuned for accuracy on test set
- Simple data preprocessing pipeline
